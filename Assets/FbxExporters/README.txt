Installing Maya Integration
--------------------------------------------

The easiest way to install the Maya integration is from the menu option in Unity.

        FbxExporters -> Install Maya Integration

This menu item locates and uses the most recent version of Maya installed. If you want 
to specify a custom version or location then set your MAYA_LOCATION environment 
before running Unity.

Alternately, you can install the package and integrations from the command-line
using a script, an example of which can be found in the scripts folder of the 
Maya integration. The version for OSX is called install_maya_plugin.sh.

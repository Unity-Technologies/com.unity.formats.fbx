Namespace is created according to the filename and is stored as an attribute on the export set.

* Fbx Exporter: "Export Model" option exports with global transform

Center Objects option is disabled by default but still available in the export settings.

* Fbx Export Settings: Add LOD export option

Added 3 options for LOD export: Highest, Lowest, All.
If "Highest" is selected, then only highest LOD is exported in the hierarchy for GameObjects with LOD groups, and
vice versa for "Lowest". If All is selected, behaviour will be the same as before, exporting all LODs.
NOTE: will ignore any LOD meshes not directly parented under the object containing the LOD group.

FIXES

* ConvertToPrefab: Don't re-export fbx model instances

If the object being exported in the scene is an fbx model instance, then create the prefab with the FbxPrefab component,
and attach it to the existing fbx without re-exporting the fbx.

**Version**: sprint46

NEW FEATURES

* Unity Maya Integration: Allow multi file import

Added ability to select multiple files to import. A different export set is created for each file imported.
If a file "model.fbx" is imported, and an animation file with the following naming format: "model@anim.fbx"
is imported, the animation file will be added into the model's export set and additional custom attributes will
be added showing which animation file is applied to the model. Currently there has to be a 1-1 mapping of
animation file to model file.

* Unity Maya Integration: Allow multi file export by scene selection

In order to choose which sets to export, select desired objects in scene, then click Unity->Export Model Only order
Unity->Export Animation Only. All sets containing at least one object in the selection set will be exported.

If "Export Model Only" button is hit, then animation is not exported, and if "Export Animation Only" is clicked,
then only animation and required nodes (i.e. animated transforms) will be exported to the animation file of format "model@anim.fbx".

* Fbx Exporter: Export animation clips from Timeline

Select GameObject in hierarchy containing PlayableDirector component and right click -> "Export All Timeline Clips" to export
all tracks and animation clips on the timeline. Each track will be exported to a separate fbx file.
Select clips on timeline then go to GameObject->Export Selected Timeline Clip to export each selected timeline clip to a separate
fbx file.

FIXES
* README: remove line from README about not supporting Maya LT
* Exporter: export correct rotation order (xyz) for euler rotation animations (previously would export as zxy)
* Exporter: remove pre-rotation from euler rotation animation on skinned mesh export
* NameRemapping: fix IndexOutOfRangeException when imported object count doesn't match original object count
* PrefabAutoUpdater: fix so unit tests don't fail if auto update is turned off

**Version**: sprint45

NEW FEATURES

* (Alpha) FbxPrefabAutoUpdater: new UI to help manage name changes. 
To use the UI, disable auto-update in the FbxExporter settings, then right-click on a linked prefab in the project view and select "Update from FBX"

* FbxExporter: Added animation only export

Use GameObject menu or context menu to select "Export Animation Only". Animation will be taken from
Animation and Animator components. All animation clips will be saved to the same fbx.
The first clip exported will be the default clip from the root Animator or Animation component.

**Version**: 1.3.0a1

FIXES
* FbxExporter: fixed so last keyframe is exported
* fix Universal Windows Platform build errors

Error caused by UnityFbxSdk.dll being set as compatible with any platform instead of editor only.

* FbxExporter: Added support for exporting Lights with animated properties (Intensity, Spot Angle, Color)
* FbxExporter: Added support for exporting Cameras with animated properties (Field of View)

FIXES
* FbxExporter: fixed issue where animations would sometimes be exported before their components, causing errors
* FbxExporter: fixed bug where skinning weights were incorrect on export

KNOWN ISSUES
* When exporting with an animated transform for a Camera or a Light, the resulting rotation does not take the forward direction into account and is off by 90 degrees
* Key tangents are not exported and the default key tangent setting is different between Unity, FBXSDK and Maya. This cause the curve shape to change between Unity and Maya.
* Animated continuous rotations are not maintained
* Animated rotations with Euler Angles (Quaternion) or Quaternion interpolation are not converted to the correct Euler equivalent.

**Version**: sprint41

NEW FEATURES
* Added support for exporting lights

A "Run Component Updater" button will appear in the FBX export settings inspector. 
Clicking the button will repair all prefabs and scene files serialized as text.
To repair binary files, first convert asset serialization mode to "Force Text" in Editor Settings (Edit->Project Settings->Editor).

NEW FEATURES

* Fbx Exporter: Added camera export support

Export game camera as film camera, with filmback settings set to 35 mm TV Projection (0.816 x 0.612).
The camera aperture with always have a height of 0.612 inches, while the width will depend on the aspect of the Unity camera,
as camera width = aspectRatio * height.
The projection type (perspective/orthogonal), aspect ratio, focal length, field of view, near plane, and far plane are also
exported. Background color and clear flags are exported as custom properties.
The last camera exported is set to the default camera in the FBX file.
NOTE: the field of view will show up as a different value in Maya. This is because Unity display's the vertical FOV,
      Maya displays the horizontal FOV.
NOTE: for GameObjects that have both a mesh and a camera component, only the mesh will be exported.

* Export Settings: Grouped settings visually into 2 categories

Categories are: Export Options and Integration

* Maya Unity Integration: Added export setting option to hide native "File->Send To Unity" menu

* Unity 3D application Integration: Different installation popup message if "Keep open" checked

To avoid misleading successful installation message popping up before installation completes, instead of 
"Enjoy the new Unity menu in {3DApp}", show "Installing Unity menu in {3DApp}, application will open once installation is complete",
if user selected to launch the 3D application after installation.

* Maya Unity Integration: Added Unity plugin version to File->Unity menu item's tooltip

* Fbx Exporter: Export GameObject visibility

If components are added/removed in Maya, the changes will be reflected in Unity (e.g. if a mesh is removed from a node,
the MeshFilter and MeshRenderer components will be removed in Unity as well.
Updating the translation/rotation/scale of a transform in Maya will update the transform in the Unity prefab.

* Move Autoload Last Saved Prefab menu item to Fbx Export Settings

Now loading the turntable scene with the latest prefab can be done via a button
in the Fbx Export Settings

* Maya Integration: Unity->Import starting directory is Unity Project

Instead of opening in the default Maya project. A side effect of this is that a workspace.mel file
gets added to the Unity project root.

* Maya Integration: Install Maya Integration menu item moved into Fbx Export Settings

Now installing the maya integration can be done via a button
in the Fbx Export Settings

* Fbx Exporter menu removed from main menu bar

* Maya Integration: Hide Configure button, guess Unity project on Unity->Import

On Unity->Import try to guess which Unity project we are loading the fbx from (if any), set it to be the project we
use in Maya if found, do nothing otherwise.

* Fbx Exporter: Allow GameObjects and/or components to specify the mesh to export

Added callbacks to allow the GameObject or components to specify the mesh that should be exported, fallback
to using the MeshFilter or SkinnedMeshRenderer meshes.

* Fbx Prefab: Added OnUpdate event that returns which GameObjects were updated

The returned objects include all objects in the temporary instance that were created, changed parent, or had a component
that was created, destroyed, or updated. 
The event happens before changes are applied to the prefab, so any further modification of the returned GameObjects
will be applied as well.

On Unity->Import, store the path and filename of the imported FBX as attributes on the export set.
On Unity->Publish, if path and filename attributes are set, publish directly to this location without prompting user.

* Maya Integration: Unity->Import creates export set containing imported objects

If an export set already exists, replace its contents with newly imported objects

* Maya Integration: Unity->Publish exports what is in the export set

Export contents of export set, or if there is no export set, then the current selection will be exported.

* Maya Integration: Fbx export options are set from a file in the Unity project

Export settings stored in Integrations/Autodesk/maya2017/scripts/unityFbxExportSettings.mel are loaded into Maya before
exporting either with Unity->Review or Unity->Publish.

FIXES

* Export Settings: fix export path doesn't refresh if selectable text box selected
* Convert to Prefab: fix model added to wrong scene if multiple scenes open

**Version**: 0.0.10a

NEW FEATURES

* Turntable Review shows minimal Unity window

The Game window is maximized so that it takes up most of the layout.

* Turntable Review frames camera onto model

* Turntable Review rotates model

Model rotates either when selected in the editor or in play mode.

* Maya Integration: Turntable Review publishes to temporary location

Running Unity -> Review command in Maya publishes the asset to a temporary location inside the Unity project.

* Maya Integration: Added support for multiple Maya versions

* Set Turntable scene from Project Settings

Scene to use for Turntable review can be selected in Project Settings.

* Select Turntable Base GameObject by attaching FbxTurnTableBase script

Attaching the FbxTurnTableBase script to a GameObject will parent the model being reviewed under this GameObject.
If none present, an empty GameObject will be used as the base.

FIXES

* FbxPrefab: Don't allow settings to be changed on prefab instance
* Maya Integration: Fix so review brings Unity window to front on Windows if already open

**Version**: 0.0.9a

* Auto updater for instanced prefabs

Convert To Prefab will now create both a .prefab file and a FBX file from the selected GameObject hierarchy. The newly instanced prefab will automatically update whenever the FBX file changes. The instanced prefab will now include updates whenever objects are added or removed from the source FBX file.

* Maya-to-Unity turntable review workflow

Unity One Click integration for Maya 2017 now includes a "Review in Unity" feature.

You can review how your Model looks in Unity by clicking "Unity->Review" menu Item. This will start Unity and your Model will be loaded into "FbxExporters_TurnTableReview" scene. If the scene cannot be found then an empty scene will be created for you. If the scene contains a "Turntable" object then your model will be parented under that object.

While Unity has the "FbxExporters_TurnTableReview" scene active it will automatically update each time you publish a Model. If you've changed the active scene and want to go back to the reviewing you can run the command "FbxExporters->Turntable Review->Auto Load Last Saved Prefab". If you have unmodified scene changes in a previously saved scene then you'll be prompted to save these changes before the active scene is switched for you. If the scene is an Untitled but modified scene then these changes will be left as-is and the active scene will be switched.

* FBXSDK C# unitypackage with docs ready for release

**Version**: 0.0.8a

**Version**: 0.0.7a 

NEW FEATURES

* Export with common center

Now if you export multiple root objects, they will export so they are centered around the union of their bounding boxes.
Added an option to preferences to toggle whether the objects are exported with a common center or not.

* Handle export of Quads

If submesh has triangle or quad topology in Unity, then it will have same topology in FBX.

* Enforce unique names in exported Fbx

Rename objects with duplicate names when exporting to ensure naming stays consistent, as
both Maya and Unity rename objects with duplicate names on import. 

* Save Application name and version to Fbx

Save name and version of FbxExporter to file when exporting.

* Added export performance test

Test exporting a large mesh and fail if export takes too long.

FIXES

* Export: Export rotation in XYZ order instead of ZXY so Maya always imports rotation correctly
* Export: Improved performance by caching Mesh data (i.e. triangles, tangents, vertices, etc.)
* Export: Set emissive color default to 0 so material does not appear white if no emissive color found.
* Export: Write first to temporary file to avoid clobbering destination file if export cancelled.
* Convert to Model: Fixed so "GameObject/Convert to Model" menu item works
* Convert to Model: Ensure imported model name matches incremented filename
* Convert to Model: Don't reference embedded materials of original model in new model.
* Convert to Model: If existing filename ends with a number, increment it instead of appending 1 (i.e. Sphere_1 becomes Sphere_2 instead of Sphere_1 1)

**Version**: 0.0.6a 

NEW FEATURES

* Model prefab path preference

Added a preference to the Fbx Export Preferences to control where Convert to Model saves models.

* FbxExporter Maya plugin

Added a Maya plugin with one click integration from within Unity to install the plugin into Maya 2017. 
Headless install option also available through command line.
The plugin creates a Unity menu item with 3 options in the drop down menu: Configure, Review, and Publish.
The menu options do not yet have any functionality.

**Version**: 0.0.5a 

NEW FEATURES

* Automatic file naming 

When exporting the default filename is name of top level selection. If multiple objects are selected then we use the last name exported or if it’s the first time then we use Untitled.fbx.

Added option to rename Object and Material names on export to be Maya compatible.

We ensure that generated filenames do not contain invalid characters.

* Reliable file system units 

Export in cm units, mesh set to real world (meter) scale. No import options need to be adjusted between Unity and Maya.

* Freeze transform on export

For selection containing a single object then zero out its transform in the FBX so it is at the world centre in Maya.
For selection containing multiple objects then export their global transforms.

* Support exporting multiple materials per mesh

* Support exporting mesh instances

Instanced meshes are exported once and then shared between FbxNodes.

* Support exporting all available UV sets

TODO: publish video demonstrating feature

* Unit Tests

Added test for default selection behaviour.

FIXES

* Export : Set default Albedo colour to white instead of grey if not found in source material so that it uses the same default as a new material.
* Convert to Model : copy component values for components that already between the source hierarchy and the imported copy.
* Convert to Model : ensure only called once from context menu with multiple selection.
* Convert to Model: ensure instanced prefab linked to prefab on disk
* Convert to Model: don’t overwrite existing files for example, if “Sphere.fbx” exists then the file will be called “Sphere1.fbx”
* Convert to Model: ensure order of copied siblings in matches original; ensure all GameObjects have unique names before export

# Converting GameObjects to Nested Prefabs

In order to convert existing Linked Prefabs or new FBX files to Nested Prefabs, follow these steps:

1. Right click the fbx file and select “Prefab Variant” to create a variant prefab that links to the FBX

Note: If converting an existing Linked Prefab, then the components from the Linked Prefab will need to be manually copied to the variant.
Note: With Variant Prefabs, the name remapping functionality will be lost, so make sure to fix any name discrepancies before converting.

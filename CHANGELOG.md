## [4.0.0-pre.1] - 2020-10-16
### Changed
- The Export and Convert to Prefab options can now be changed in the FBX Export Settings in Edit > Project Settings > Fbx Export.
    - The Export and Convert to Prefab Options windows will use these settings by default.
    - When modifying the settings in the Export/Convert to Prefab windows, the Project Settings are no longer updated, but the changes persist for the remainder of the Unity session.
- Disable buttons such as the "Install Integration" button when editing an FBX export setting preset.
- Rename "Show Convert UI" in project settings to "Display Options Window" and use it for both the Convert and Export windows instead of just the Convert to Prefab window.
- Updated the FBX SDK bindings to 4.0.0-pre.1
    - Made FBX SDK bindings Editor only so they are not copied into builds by default. In order to use at runtime, 
      add the FBXSDK_RUNTIME define to Edit > Project Settings... > Player > Other Settings > Scripting Define Symbols.
- Use DeepConvertScene from Autodesk® FBX SDK to convert from Unity (left handed system with odd parity) to Autodesk® Maya® (right handed system with odd parity) axis system.
    - Previously the conversion was performed by the FBX exporter.
    - For the majority of cases there will be no noticeable difference in the final export result. If any custom export code that is affected by the axis system has been added or modified, it will
      need to use Unity's axis system (left handed with odd parity), instead of converting directly to Autodesk® Maya®'s.
    - There may be discrepancies in the Aim constraint and Parent constraint export result compared to before, however these should still import correctly into Autodesk® Maya® and other DCCs.
- Export animation curve tangents instead of baking animation.
    - For more details see https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.formats.fbx@4.0/manual/exporting.html#animation
- Change dependency on Unity Recorder to an optional one so it is no longer immediately installed when installing the FBX exporter package.
- Update minimum supported Unity version to 2019.4.

### Fixed
- Fix Export Model and Convert to Prefab Variant setting presets not serializing settings properly.
- Fix NullReferenceException when modifying a preset for the FBX export settings in Edit > Project Settings > Fbx Export.
- Fix error in an export when the project settings are not writeable (e.g. if you're using Perforce).
- Fix Compatible Naming checkbox not aligned properly in Export/Convert UI.
- FBX SDK bindings no longer included in builds, fixing an issue with shipping on the Mac App Store.

### Known issues
- Negative scale will not export properly.
    
## [3.2.1-preview.2] - 2020-08-05
### Added
- Add an export option to preserve model import settings when overwriting an fbx file.
- Add the option to export FBX files outside of the Assets folder.

### Changed
- Renamed label in Autodesk® Maya® from Unity Fbx Namespace to Strip Specific Namespace.
- Renamed Export as FBX Linked Prefab to Export as FBX Prefab Variant.
- Mesh instances are now exported as instances of a single mesh instead of exporting multiple, identical meshes.
- Updated to latest com.autodesk.fbx (3.1.0-preview.2).
- Updated minimum supported Unity version to 2018.4.

### Fixed
- No longer initiate export if no objects are selected in Autodesk® 3ds Max®.
- Added a null check for bones, so export no longer fails if a skeleton has missing bones.
- Fix incorrect relative paths for textures in FBX files.
- Fix for Editor focus lockup when creating an FBX Prefab Variant on Mac.

## [3.2.0-preview.2] - 2020-05-19
### Added
- Added an option to the Autodesk® Maya® integration Unity menu for creating an export set.
    - The option can be found in File > Unity > Create Export Set
    - Selecting this option will open a dialog allowing the user to select the desired export locations for model and animation files.
    - File > Unity > Export [Model Only|Animation Only] will also open the same dialog if the objects selected for export
      are not already in an export set.

### Changed
- Do not search for Autodesk® installs in `D:/Program Files/Autodesk` (not a standard drive).
- Update Unity Recorder dependency to version 2.2.0-preview.4.

### Fixed
- Added a null check when inspecting whether a Timeline Clip is selected for export. This fixes a NullReferenceException when an object in the selection is null.
- Fix issue where different Materials and Meshes with identical names export as a single material/mesh.
- Fix skinned mesh always exports in bind pose regardless of current pose.
- Import/Export in Maya Integration fails if FBX Import/Export settings file missing.

## [3.1.0-preview.1] - 2020-04-02
### Fixed
- Blendshapes naming in FBX so that multiple blendshapes all import correctly in Autodesk® Maya®. Thank you to @lazlo-bonin for the fix.
- Don't override transforms when creating FBX Linked Prefab, so that the prefab updates properly when the FBX transforms are modified.
- Changed FBX Linked Prefab to keep Unity materials instead of using materials exported to FBX file.
    - To revert to using the FBX materials in the Linked Prefab, open the prefab editor and remove the material overrides.
- Fix issue where root bone is imported as null object in Autodesk® Maya® if it doesn't have any descendants that are also bones.
- Don't reduce keyframes after recording as it can create unnecessary errors/discrepancies in the exported curve.
- Updated to latest com.autodesk.fbx (3.0.1-preview.1), to fix DLL not found errors if building for non-standalone platforms (e.g. Android, WebGL).

## [3.0.1-preview.2] - 2020-01-22
### Added
- Added option to export geometry when recording with the FBX recorder (in previous version geometry was always exported).
- Added settings to transfer animation between two transforms in the recorded hierarchy.

### Fixed
- It is now possible to record animated characters with the FBX recorder.

## [3.0.0-preview.2] - 2020-01-13
### Added
- Added FBX Recorder to record animations from the Unity Recorder directly to FBX (adds dependency to Unity Recorder).
- Export animated focal length and lens shift of cameras.

### Changed
- Updated dependency to com.autodesk.fbx version 3.0.0-preview.1, which means we update to [FBX SDK 2020](http://help.autodesk.com/view/FBX/2020/ENU/).

### Fixed
- Fixed camera aspect and gate fit exporting as incorrect values.

### Known Issues
- Using the FBX Recorder to record animated characters is not supported yet, and fails in some cases.

	* Added option to export animation only.
	* Added option not to export animation on skinned meshes.
	* Added option to export meshes without renderers.
	* Added LOD export option.
* `UnityMayaIntegration`: 
	* Allows multiple file import.
	* Allows multiple file export by scene selection.
* `FbxPrefabAutoUpdater`: Added new UI to help manage name changes.
* `FbxExporter`: 
	* Added support for exporting Blendshapes.
	* Added support for exporting SkinnedMeshes with legacy and generic animation.
	* Added support for exporting Lights with animatable properties (Intensity, Spot Angle, Color).
	* Added support for exporting Cameras with animatable properties (Field of View).
	* Added ability to export animation on transforms.
* Added one-button import and export for Autodesk® Maya®, Autodesk® Maya® LT, and Autodesk® 3ds Max®.
* Added Camera export support.
* Added the ability to export FBX files from Unity.
* Added a linked Prefab converter to create a Prefab that auto-updates with the linked FBX file.

FIXES
* `ConvertToPrefab`: 
	* Fixed an issue where the Mesh Collider was not pointing to the exported Mesh after conversion.
	* Now no longer re-exports FBX Model instances.
* `FbxExporter`: 
	* Fixed an issue where Compatible Naming doesn't modify the Scene while exporting.
	* Now links Materials to objects connected to Mesh instances.
	* Now exports Meshes in Model Prefab instances as Mesh instances in the FBX file.
	* Fixed an issue where animating spot angle in Unity was failing to animate the cone angle in Autodesk® Maya® (not the penumbra).
	* Now exports the correct rotation order (xyz) for euler rotation animations (previously would export as zxy).
* `FbxExportSettings`: Fixed the console error on Mac when clicking **Install Unity Integration**.
* Fixed Universal Windows Platform build errors caused by `UnityFbxSdk.dll` being set as compatible with any platform instead of the Editor only.
* Fixed an issue where Object references were lost when using **Convert to Linked Prefab Instance**.
* Fixed an issue with Autodesk® Maya® Integration dropdown not appearing in the FBX Export options.

KNOWN ISSUES
* Cannot export animation only from Autodesk® 3ds Max®.
* `FbxExporter`: 
	* Animated skinned Meshes must be in the bind pose on export (that is, not being previewed in the Animation or Timeline windows, and the original rig's FBX must not contain animation).
	* Animated Meshes in bone hierarchy are not supported.
	* For skinned Meshes, all bones must be descendants of the root bone.
* `3DIntegration`: FBX files containing rigs must have file units in centimeters in order to properly apply animation exported from Unity.
* `ConvertToPrefab`: Converting Model instances that have been modified in the Scene won't re-export the FBX file.
* Requires Unity 2018.1.0.
* When exporting with an animated transform for a Camera or a Light, the resulting rotation does not take the forward direction into account and is off by 90 degrees.
* The FBX Exporter does not export key tangents and the default key tangent setting is different between Unity, the FBX SDK and Autodesk® Maya®. This causes the curve shape to change between Unity and Autodesk® Maya®.
* The FBX Exporter does not maintain animated continuous rotations.
* The FBX Exporter does not convert animated rotations with Euler Angles (Quaternion) or Quaternion interpolation, to the correct Euler equivalent.

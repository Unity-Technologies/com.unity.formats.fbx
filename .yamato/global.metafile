# Nightly trigger editors by release.
#
# When adding a new release version, add a new section
# to nightly_tested_releases for the release
# containing the name with underscores to separate the numbers, 
# the branch name and editors that it should run on.
#
# Make sure all editor versions specified are included in all_test_editors section as well.
#
# Additionally, update the previous release nightly versions if necessary.
# For example, removing trunk from the list of editors for the previous release.

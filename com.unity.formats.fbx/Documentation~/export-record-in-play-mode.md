# Record FBX animations in Play mode

Use the [Recorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.recorder@latest) package (version 4.0.0 or higher) in addition to the FBX Exporter package to record the animation of a GameObject in Play mode and export it as an FBX animation.

Depending on your needs, you can record the animation via:
* [The Recorder window](export-record-in-play-mode-recorder-window.md), or
* [A Timeline Recorder Track](export-record-in-play-mode-recorder-clip.md).

4. Click on **Export**.

The FBX Exporter exports the selected GameObjects and all their children GameObjects to a single FBX file in the folder specified in **Export Path**.

>[!NOTE]
>* If your selection includes multiple GameObjects that have no hierarchical relationship, the FBX Exporter includes the whole selection in the same exported FBX file.
>* If your selection includes both a parent and one of its children, the FBX Exporter exports the whole as if you had selected the parent only.
